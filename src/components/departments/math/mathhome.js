      The Department of Mathematics was established in 1924 and department offer
      several courses that support other engineering departments. Recently a new
      program Integrated M. Sc. in Mathematics is started and running
      successfully from the academic year 2015-2016. Current faculty strength of
      the department is nine and they are experienced in teaching and research
      in several branches of Mathematics. Department of Mathematics is one of
      the backbone of the Institution as it is an essential department for
      engineering courses up to Ph.D level.

      The Department of Mathematics will offer courses and programs of study
      that will ensure that the student learner will be able to contribute to
      today's society. The students will obtain abilities to critically assess
      numerical and graphical information; learn to formulate strategies for
      solving problems; and acknowledge the importance of being intellectually
      curious throughout their adult lives. The Department, through its faculty,
      will continue to contribute to the body of knowledge of the discipline,
      whether in traditional research, applied research, or research in the
      teaching of mathematics.

      The main mission of the Department of Mathematics is to offer high quality
      instruction in mathematics, statistics and the applied sciences to all
      students that it serves. The department strives to teach the main ideas
      and methods of mathematics and to build up the students reasoning and
      analytical skills. The department maintains programs and teaching
      practices that match those at most Undergraduate/Postgraduate programs at
      Institute. As the department offers core courses and in addition support
      other engineering degree programs, our mission is to make sure that these
      courses are taught at a high standard and meet the needs of those
      programs. For its majors, the department mission is to provide students
      with a number of degree programs and a wide spectrum of courses, and to
      offer them a rigorous training that enables them to pursue graduate
      degrees or work in jobs that require a high degree of mathematical skills.
