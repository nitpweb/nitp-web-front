   The Department's faculty have received many sponsored R&D projects funded by
   central agencies such as MHRD, DRDO, DST, MeitY The resources of VLSI LAB
   have been upgraded with the support of SMDP-C2SD project. The department
   possesses a highly qualified group of young, competent and highly motivated
   faculty and staff members who have adopted and implemented some of the best
   academic practices in teaching and research. Department is organizing
   international and national seminar ,faculty development programme, GIAN
   programme, students training programme by industry experts, invited lectures
   by eminent academicians and resource persons from industries for up gradation
   and sharing of technical knowledge. Department is organizing training
   programs and FDP supported by E & ICT Academy, NIT Patna and TEQIP III
   project in every semester.
   <br />
   <br />
   The students of the department have been securing top ranks in national
   competitive examinations such as GATE and CAT. Students from the department
   have been regularly recruited by several public sector and MNC companies with
   high package. Ever year, about 10% of ECE graduate (B.Tech) students are
   going for pursue post graduate and doctoral studies in the top-rated
   Universities in India and abroad. The students of the department have won
   prizes in different national & international technical competitions and
   sports events. Some of the students group are motivated towards
   entrepreneurship development and have started Start-up Company with the help
   of institute's incubation centre. In all courses, the Department has built an
   excellent reputation for its graduates in terms of placements.
