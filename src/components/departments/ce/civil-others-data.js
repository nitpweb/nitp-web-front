        <p>
          Geotechnical engineering laboratory is equipped to perform all the
          necessary basic characterization of soils and several advanced testing
          facilities. A typical geotechnical engineering laboratory helps in
          identifying the engineering behavior of geomaterials (soils and rocks)
          and by-products such as fly ash etc. There are different physical,
          chemical and geotechnical properties determined in the laboratory that
          is required for identifying the geomaterials. This information is used
          by geotechnical engineer for designing the type of foundations,
          earthworks such as dams, embankments, tunnels, reservoirs, pavement
          subgrades etc. The preciseness of such design is entirely based on the
          experimental information obtained from a geotechnical laboratory.
          Therefore, geotechnical engineering laboratory has a great role to
          play in rendering the subsurface a safe and stable load bearing medium

          EqSC was inaugurated on 20th January 2015 by the Chairperson of BSDMA
          and Chief Minister of Bihar. EqSC at NIT Patna recognizes the
          importance of research and development in the areas of disaster risk
          reduction (DRR), as well as, involvement of engineeringfaculty &
          students in dissemination of DRR knowledge to the grass-root
