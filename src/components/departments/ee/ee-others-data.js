   <h3>Research Laboratories</h3>
   <p>
    The Department of Electrical Engineering has multiple
    laboratories/facilities which are engaged in interesting and cutting-edge
    research projects. The details of those laboratories are as follows:
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong>1. Advanced Instrumentation Lab: </strong>
    </h3>
    <br />
    Dr. Arunangshu Ghosh with his team of students is working towards the
    development of a portable electronic tongue for estimation of tea quality
    and spoilage detection of food samples. The other work in progress is
    development of the Potentiostat System for General Purpose Electro-Chemical
    Applications. These systems are developed to develop automated systems for
    quality analysis of different agricultural and food samples. Besides,
    technology using near infrared spectroscopy based development (NIR) is also
    being carried out for developing non-invasive, portable and optical
    solutions for quality analysis of food samples. Software like Matlab,
    LABView, and MPLAB are regularly used to train students for carrying out
    researches in this lab. Two externally sponsored research projects have been
    completed successfully in this laboratory.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong>2. Control Lab: </strong>
    </h3>
    A project design and development of low-cost BLDC motor drive for solar PV
    based irrigation system. One externally sponsored research project has been
    completed successfully in this laboratory
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong> 3. Industrial Drives and Control Lab:</strong>
    </h3>
    The group of students led by Dr. Vimlesh Verma works towards the development
    of control techniques for electrical machine drives. High end hardware
    simulators like HIL, and software like DSpace are a part of this lab. One
    externally sponsored research project has been completed successfully in
    this laboratory.
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong>4.SCADA Lab:</strong>
    </h3>
    This space is equipped with the facilities where Interfacing of wind
    turbines with power systems and realization of hardware of grid using
    supervisory control can be done by masters and PhD students.
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong> 5. NIT Patna campus smart metered distribution system:</strong>
    </h3>
    This enables us to get the real time measurement of power, current,
    frequency, voltage and other electrical parameters throughout the system at
    different nodes. The dataset created acts as an asset and allows us to work
    further on load forecasting, demand side management, generation and
    distribution planning, also renewable generation planning). One externally
    sponsored research project under Dr. Mala De has been completed successfully
    in this laboratory.
    <br />
    <h3>
     <strong> 6. Power electronics Lab:</strong>
    </h3>
    A team of students along with Dr. Ambarisha Mishra is working on a six-phase
    induction motor drive.
