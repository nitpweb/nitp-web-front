   The Department of Electrical Engineering in National Institute of Technology
   Patna (Formerly known as Bihar College of Engineering) was established in
   1945 under Patna University with an intake of 45 students leading to a
   Bachelor of Science (Engineering) degree of four-year duration. In the year
   1978 AICTE approved Post Graduate (PG) course leading to M.Sc. (Engg.) Degree
   in two specializations: (i) Power System Engineering and (ii) Control System
   Engineering. The department is also offering the Ph.D. research program since
   2009
   <br />
   <br />
   The Department offers the following academic programs:
   <br />
   1. B. Tech. in Electrical Engineering (151 Seats)
   <br />
   2. Dual Degree (B.Tech.+M. Tech. (Power System)) (10 Seats)
   <br />
   3. M. Tech.
   <br />
   <ul>
    <li>Control Systems Engineering -22 seats</li>
    <br />
    <li>Power Systems Engineering-10 seats</li>

   <br />
   <br />
   The Department of Electrical Engineering carries out research and consultancy
   projects from Government and private organizations. In the last five years,
   the faculty members of the department completed sponsored research projects
   of total value 427 lacs. Research projects of approximately 212 lacs is
   running in the department. Apart from that, the department also completed
   consultancy projects amounting to approximately 53 lacs. The Department of
   Electrical Engineering, NIT Patna has been awarded with the DST-FIST project
   for improving research facilities in the domain of power systems, power
   electronics and Industrial drives, and Control systems on 31.10.2023 for a
   period of five years. The sanctioned amount of 82 Lacs will facilitate
   teaching and research activities in the state of art technologies in power
   transmission and distribution systems, active power filters, multilevel
   inverters, advanced fault tolerant control techniques, renewable energies,
   and electric vehicles. The Department envisages to develop new courses,
   patentable technologies, training programs, quality publications, and extend
   the developed facilities to the researchers of other institutes with the
   received support. The department also contributes in the upbringing of
   society and other educational institutes by providing training, workshops,
   faculty development program, and awareness programs. The department organizes
   the “International conference on Emerging Frontiers in Electrical and
   Electronic Technologies (ICEFEET)” regularly to deliberate, exchange ideas,
   and produce research collaborations for the technologies those have the
   potential to significantly impact the domains of Power system, Power
   Converters, Control systems, Machine Drives, Embedded systems, Measurement
   and instrumentation technologies.
