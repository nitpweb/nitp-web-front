      The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 1945 under
      Patna University with an intake of 20 students leading to Bachelor of
      Science(Engineering) degree of four year duration.The four year course was
      later changed to five year integrated course in 1960 with intake of 30
      students and it continued up to 1972. Again four year course was
      introduced in 1972 with the same intake capacity of 30 students. The
      intake was increased from 30 to 40 students in 2005-06 sessions and
      further in 2006-07 the intake capacity has been increased to 60 students.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the year 1978 AICTE approved Post Graduate (PG) course leading to M.
      Sc. (Engg) Degree in two specializations: (i) Power System Engineering and
      (ii) Control System Engineering with an intake capacity of 10 in each
      specialization.The intake in PG program was further increased to 18
      students per specialization in 2004-05.The Microprocessor Laboratory and
      Power electronics laboratory were setup to meet the requirement of course
      curriculum and research activity.The advancement and application of
      electronics and microcomputer in the field of electrical engineering
      necessitated a major revision of the syllabus for the UG program in 1977.
      A course in Microprocessor was introduced along with many subjects in
      electronics leading to orientation required for the modem technology, such
      as Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Introduction to Communication
      and Digital Signal Processing.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Electrical Engineering department has well qualified faculty, majority
      of them are with Ph. D and M. Tech degree with specialization in the field
      of electrical power, control system and microcomputer based
      instrumentation & control. The department has well qualified panel of
      visiting faculty from academics and industry. They visit to the department
      at regular interval to deliver expert lectures and discuss recent trends
      in the field of Electrical Engg, Power system -generation, transmission
      and distribution, Thyristorised controlled electrical drives used in
      industry, microcomputer applications in instrumentation and control etc.
      In recent past, the faculty and students of the department have many
      publications in journals and conferences (Approx. Forty). Many books on
      different electrical engineering subjects have been authored by the
      faculties of the department. Till date the department has produces five
      Ph. Ds under Patna University. From 2009 Doctoral program started under
      NIT Act 2007 and students have been admitted and are continuing research.
